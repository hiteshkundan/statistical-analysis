Logistic Regression for Health Data Classification
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to apply logistic regression to a health-related dataset. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation using Python's data science libraries.

Dataset
The dataset contains health-related features such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and physical activity. It has been used to train a logistic regression model that predicts a binary outcome based on these features.

Results
The model achieves an accuracy score of 84.8%, indicating a strong performance in classifying the data.
